I created this as a project to Learn Ruby, Rails, CSS3, HTML5 and whatever else I could throw in. This site is largely based on a tutorial site made through the <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl", "http://www.railstutorial.org" %>. Information was sourced through the <%= link_to "Soul Sacrifice Wikia", "soulsacrifice.wikia.com/â€Ž" %> and various other gaming communitys like <%= link_to "GameFaqs", "http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/668738-soul-sacrifice" %> and <%= link_to "Reddit", "http://redd.it/1exvqk"%>.
